# About:
# I decided to make Starlark the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-Starlark) as Starlark is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the Starlark programming language. It only makes sense to Starlark the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
